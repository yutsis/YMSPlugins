This plugin displays contents of any XML file or Internet resource
as an archive or directory on FAR panel.
You may do all standard FAR operations with XML elements.
Minimal editing is implemented. XPath selection and evaluation is supported.
Flexible redefinition of text displayed in columns is also possible using XPath.

The plugin uses Microsoft XML DOM services provided by msxml*.dlls.
To use this plugin on Windows 2000, get msxml3.dll and msxml3r.dll from
an XP installation.

**Installation**: create a subdir under your Plugins\ directory (e.g.
Plugins\XMLDOM), extract all the files there, restart FAR and enjoy :)

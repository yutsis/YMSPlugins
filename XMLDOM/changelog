            What's new in XML Browser Plugin for FAR
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[+] New
[-] Bugfixes
[*] Changes
[!] Attention


Version 2.50, 25 Jul 2015

[+] Identical names are displayed with indices: item[0], item[1] etc., which fixes selection problems
[-] Memory leak fixed
[!] BSD 3-clause license (just to put things in order)


Version 2.41, 25 Sep 2014

[+] Can read Unicode files without BOM signature.
[-] In Config dialog, when opened from non-XML-panels, Override Columns button is not displayed (it needs the context).


Version 2.40, 16 Aug 2014

[*] Special Definitions dialog renamed to Column Overrides.
[+] Date/time in UNIX time_t format is accepted in attribute values for column overrides.
[+] (FAR 3 only.) Column Overrides dialog can be called from Options dialog (in XML panels only)
[-] Options dialog didn't open in the last FAR 3 versions
[-] ANSI version: text nodes were not edited by F4 for the last 10 years, but who cares...


Version 2.30, 26 Dec 2012

[+] Scalar XPath expression can be evaluated on Ctrl-J; its result is displayed in the message box.
[-] Scalar XPath expressions for columns didn't work with namespaces (such as "substring(@android:name, 20)").
[-] FAR3: Ctrl-Shift-F3 on "directories" didn't work properly. (Not that it would be useful when fixed.)
[-] Could not open XML files from Plugins menu (crash or nothing).


Version 2.24, 20 Dec 2012  (FAR 3 only)

[-] Yet another cursor position bug fix (again, API change related).


Version 2.23, 19 Dec 2012  (FAR 3 only)

[-] When the plugin is open, "far /export" resulted in error 'database is opened in memory'.
[-] When going up to the parent dir, the cursor was not positioned properly (because of FAR API change).


Version 2.21/2.22, 5 Dec 2012

[*] FAR 3 API changes
[-] On file open error, "canceled by the user" message was displayed.

Version 2.20, 8 Jun 2012

[+] In Unsorted mode, Alt-Shift-Up/Down move the element up/down physically.
[+] Ctrl-Shift-F5 duplicates selected element(s).
[+] Namespace prefixes can be used in XPath expressions.
[*] The plugin starts in Unsorted mode (configurable).
[*] msxml4 and msxml6 are no more used because they don't allow simple XPath selection
	when default namespace is defined. Only msxml3.dll is used.
[-] Fixed sorting names with slashes.
[-] XPath column overrides were not saved if only Owner was redefined for the element.


Version 2.10, 16 May 2012

[+] Versions for Far 3.0 (32- and 64-bit), now 5 versions are built in total
[!] NOTE: the plugin for Far 3.0 can read XPath column definitions from registry stored 
    by older versions, but it saves them only in Far3 database.
[*] When invoked from the command line, the XML path is separated from the filename
    with ':' instead of '|', so the syntax looks exactly like in history items.
[+] "Scalar" XPath expressions and functions are possible in user-defined XPath columns.
[+] msxml6.dll is used if present.
[+] New-style package with subdirectory and Renewal.xml for Renewal plugin (FAR3)
[-] Multi-line error messages (e.g. parse errors) were not displayed properly.
[-] In 64-bit FAR, access violation could occur on pressing Ctrl-J or Alt-Shift-F11
[-] In 64-bit FAR, F4 couldn't edit elements.
[-] Editing problems in unicode-only FAR installations where files could not be found
    because of relative path names.
[-] The plugin allowed editing by Alt-Shift-F4 but could not import multiple elements,
    so now it works like Alt-Shift-F3 (as it should by help).


Version 2.00, 20 Aug 2009

[+] Unicode and x64 versions.
[+] Experimental: user-defined XPath rules for column contents.
    See the help for details.
[-] Byte-order mark is added at the beginning when exporting in UTF-8 format
     if international characters are present.
[-] Int'l characters in file name were corrupted when XML file is saved


Version 1.35, 18 Aug 2004

[+] Shift-Enter opens the element in the default browser or other XML program.
[+] The file can be edited on parsing errors while opening.
[-] International characters in file names were not treated correctly.


Version 1.31, 17 Nov 2003

[-] MSVCP60.DLL is no more required for the plugin.

Version 1.30, 14 Nov 2003

[+] MSXML 4.0 (implemented by msxml4.dll) is used if found.
    (To force using old msxml3.dll, create DWORD value ForceMSXML3
    under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far\Plugins\YMS\XMLDOM
    and set it to 1.)
[+] Shift-F3 views element/schema definitions (if present).
[+] Alt-Shift-Ins works as it should.
[-] XPath selection didn't work on prefixed tags.
[+] Root element's attributes are displayed in the Info panel.
[+] Documents can be validated on load if the Validate option is enabled.
[+] "Resolve Externals" option is added. See the help for details.
[*] By default, "Resolve Externals" is OFF (was ON).
[-] After saving changes on exit, the plugin didn't exit actually.


Version 1.21, 23 Oct 2003

[+] XPath selection implemented. See the help for details.
[+] Ctrl-F puts XPath of the current item into the command line.
    XPath format is also used to display the current path in the command 
    prompt and in commands like Ctrl-].
[+] Ctrl-N toggles data displayed in the Name column: tags or ID attributes.
[+] Ctrl-H toggles description display for big elements (>500 items).
    Disabling it will significantly reduce rescanning time.
[+] "Add to Plugins Menu" option added. When enabled, the plugin displays
    "XML browser" item in the plugin menu (F11). When it is selected,
    the current file under cursor is opened.
[+] The version of MSXML3.DLL is displayed in the Info panel.
[+] Alt-Shift-F3 and Alt-Shift-F4 view selected nodes. (Saving not 
    implemented.)
[-] Fixed the problem of cursor bar positioning when going up to the parent
    element if there are duplicated names in it.


Version 1.1, 19 Sep 2003

[*] Browsing begins from the document, not from the top level element.
[*] Text, comments and CDATA are exported as raw data (not XML),
    and always in Windows code page. 
[+] Elements, text, comments and CDATA can be edited by F4.
[+] F7 creates an element. (Pretty useless with no Shift-F4 import.)
[+] Name Column Attributes option added to Configuration menu.
[*] Attributes come first in unsorted mode, because they come first 
    in the XML file.
[*] XML header is added only if international characters were found in 
    the exported XML.
[+] Panel mode is saved.
[-] Too long file names are truncated now during export.
[-] XML parser international error messages were displayed incorrectly.
[-] F4 on ".." can edit the current element.


Version 1.0, 4 May 2003

[+] Elements can be exported either in UTF-8 or in Windows format.
    A header is added if necessary.
{+] File saving implemented (Shift-F2) to use for editing.
[+] Attributes, text elements and comments can be edited with Ctrl-Z.
[+] Elements and attributes can be deleted.
[+] Configuration dialog added.
[+] Added "Don't open files" option. It is useful for searching in archives.
[-] International tags and names were displayed in a wrong code page.
[-] Pressing Cancel during long operations caused an exception.
[-] Skip and Skip All buttons in the overwrite dialog didn't work 
    correctly.

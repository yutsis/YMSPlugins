@Description
$^#Description#

This plugin displays contents of any XML file (local or in the Internet)
as an archive or directory.
The "subdirs" are XML elements (tags) inside the current element, and the 
"files" are attributes of the current element, text contents, comments
and CDATA sections.

The plugin uses Microsoft XML DOM services provided by #msxml3.dll#.

Elements are displayed by their "Name" attribute, or by "Id", or, if neither 
was found, by their tag names. (You can add more naming attributes.)
Root element is always displayed by tag name.
You can force tag display in the Name column by #Ctrl-N#.

Attribute values and text inside elements are displayed in the Description 
column. Tag names are displayed in the Owner column.

If two or more elements have the same tag, then their tag names are indexed:
item[0], item[1] etc.

You can view/edit any node/attribute by F3/F4 key.
If you press F3 or F4 on "..", you view the whole current element with all 
its contents.
"Sub-elements" (tagged sections inside elements) are extracted in XML format, 
but without any header. This may be changed in future.

~XPath~@XPath@ selection and evaluation is supported.

You can also open any file or Internet resource from the command line
using the #xml:# prefix, for example:
@-

 #xml:C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386\filelist.xml#
or
 #xml:http://www.livejournal.com/users/news/rss#

You can also append an ~XPath~@XPath@ suffix after the colon character ':'
to make automatic selection while opening the file:

#xml:System.xml:/doc/members/member[@@name="T:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents"]#
#xml:http://www.livejournal.com/users/news/rss://item/description|//item/pubDate#

If the result of selection contains only one member, the plugin enters
inside it, as if it were "change directory" command.

@Problems
$^#Known Problems and Troubleshooting#

The message #Class not registered# possibly means that msxml3.dll is not present,
or it is registered.
Make sure it is present in your System32 directory and register it:
#regsvr32 msxml3.dll#.

Windows XP and above and Internet Explorer 5.0 and above include msxml3.dll.

@Keyboard
$^#Keyboard Commands#

#Shift-F7#  Toggle ~"Elements as files" / "Elements as directories"~@modes@ modes.

#Ctrl-F#    Put XPath of the current item into the command line.

#Alt-Shif-Ins# Take XPaths of current items into the clipboard.

#Ctrl-G#    Put the value from Descriptions column into the
          command line.

#Ctrl-Z#    Open description in edit dialog box. Only attributes, text
          and comments can be edited currently.

#Ctrl-N#    Toggle names displayed in the Name column (tags/attributes)

#Ctrl-H#    Hide/show descriptions for nodes. This may speed up
          scanning, since the plugin doesn't need
          to look up each item's text. When there are not so many nodes
          (less than 500), their descriptions are always shown.

#Alt-Shift-F3# View the group of selected elements in a single viewer.

#Alt-Shift-F4# View the group of selected elements in a single editor.
             (Editing is not supported.)

#Alt-Shift-F11# ~Column Overrides~@Special@

#Shift-F3#  View ~definition~@ViewDef@ of the current element or
          namespace schema (if present).
          This command works only when Resolve Externals option is ON.
          
#Shift-F2#  Save changes

#Shift-Enter#  Open node in the default browser or other
             system-defined XML program.
             
#Alt-Shift-Up/Down# In Unsorted mode only: move element up or down.
                 (Not for attributes.)

#Ctrl-Shift-F5# Duplicate selected element(s).

#Note 1.# Descriptions extracted by Ctrl-G and Ctrl-Z keys are truncated
to 256 characters. To export the whole section, use View/Edit commands.

#Note 2.# Alt-Shift-NumPad5 works like Alt-Shift-F3.

@Modes
$^#Operation modes#

 There are two operation modes of the plugin:

#Elements as directories.# Elements are color-highlighted if file highlighting is 
enabled in FAR) and are displayed according to sorting rules, 
before the attributes (unless in Unsorted mode). In the QuickView mode you can see the total size
of all attributes under the current element.

#Elements as files.# Elements are distinguished from attributes only if file
size is displayed; the "size" of tags is always 0. You can browse elements
in the Quick View panel mode.

If you press Ctrl-PgDn in this mode, the contents of this element
will be exported in a temporary file, and this new file will be opened by 
the plugin.

In most cases, "Elements as directories" is recommended, unless you want to
QuickView them.

To toggle between these modes, press #Shift-F7#.

@ViewDef
$^View Definition

This command views definitions.

It displays:

if DTD is present - the document's DTD;

if XDR schema is present - the node's type definition.

This behaviour may change in future.

This command works only when Resolve Externals option is ON.

@Config
$^#Configuration#
@-
#Export XMLs in#
( ) UTF-8 code page
( ) Windows code page

@+
XML elements with international characters can be exported either in UTF-8 
format (this is the default for XML), or in your Windows code page.

#UTF-8# if more universal and preferrable, any characters can be mapped to 
it and no information is lost, but in FAR 1.xx viewer and editor can't
handle it directly. Notepad understands it well and can be used to watch
UTF-8 files when defined as alternative editor (Alt-F4).

In #Windows code page# it is possible to export only a limited set of 
characters. An XML header indicating the code page is added to file in 
this mode.

#Add to Plugins Menu#

When enabled, the plugin displays "XML browser" item in the plugin menu (F11).
When it is selected, the current file under cursor is opened.
By default, this excessive feature is disabled to decrease messing up the 
F11 menu.

#Open XML files from FAR panel#

Normally it is checked. When unchecked, it disables direct file opening by 
the plugin when you press Enter or Ctrl-PgDn, or when you search by Alt-F7 with "Search in archives" 
option enabled. You may want to uncheck this option in the latter case if 
you don't want FAR to treat XMLs as archives during the search.

Even when this option is unchecked, you can still open XML files from the 
command line using the #xml:# prefix.

#Validate XMLs on parse#

Indicates whether the document should be validated against DTDs and schema
on loading.

If disabled, XML is checked on "well-formedness" only.

#Resolve Externals#

Indicates whether external definitions, resolvable namespaces, document 
type definition (DTD) external subsets, and external entity references, 
are to be resolved at parse time, independent of validation.

To use the View Definition command (Shift-F3), this option must be ON.

#Start in Unsorted mode#

If checked (default), the plugin starts in unsorted mode when opening XML files
according to the physical order of elements in the XML file.

If unchecked, it starts in the mode that was on the panel before.

#Name Column Attributes#

List here the attributes you want to be displayed in the Name column.
Separate them by commas, semicolons or spaces. The names are case-sensitive.


@Editing
$^#Editing#

You may do the following editing operations on the XML file contents at 
present:
@-
- change attributes and text elements via Ctrl-Z dialog box;

- edit attributes and elements by the F4 editor;

- delete elements and attributes.
@+
You will see the changes on panel immediately, but the results will not be 
saved until you press #Shift-F2#.

When the contents was changed, asterisks are added to the panel title.

When you save results, the old file is remained to .bak file. The old .bak 
file is deleted.

@XPath
$^#XPath Selection#

You can use XPath query language to select a subset of nodes or to "change
directory" to any specific node.

To select nodes, press #Ctrl-J# and enter XPath expression. You will see 
the result of this selection on the panel. If you go down into one of the 
resulting nodes and exit back, you'll still see this selection. If the 
selection is on the panel and you go "up" to "..", you return to the node 
this selection was made from, and the selection is cancelled.
Another way to cancel the selection is to apply an empty XPath expression.

When you open a file or Internet resource from the command line, you can
also append an XPath after a pipe character '|' to make automatic 
selection while opening the file.

You can also evaluate XPath expressions returning a "scalar" value.
This value will be displayed in a message box.

Read more about XPath and its syntax:
 ~http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/~@http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/@
 ~http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/~@http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/@
 ~http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/xmlsdk/htm/xpath_ref_overview_0pph.asp~@http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/xmlsdk/htm/xpath_ref_overview_0pph.asp@

Examples of XPath requests:

@-
#elem#		Select all <elem> nodes under the current node.
#*/summary#	Select all <summary> subnodes of all nodes under the 
current node.
#/book/chapter[3]/para[1]#  Select the first para of the third chapter of the book
#//@@name#	Select all "name" attributes of the file
#//text()#  	Select all text elements of the file

@+
The #cd# command understands XPath requests too. When an XPath expression 
is entered in the #cd# command and its result is one single element, the 
plugin enters inside this element.

Note: some characters like quotes may not be processed correctly in the 
FAR command line. In this case, Ctrl-J selection works well.

@Special
$^#Column Overrides#

For any given XML element of any specific document type, you can define relative XPath expressions for the text
to be displayed in #Name#, #Date/Time#, #Decription# and #Owner# columns.

To do it, press Alt-Shift-F11 when the cursor is located on the element for which you want to define them.

The following fields can be filled in the dialog:

#Root document tag# (mandatory) - the root tag of the current document.
   Auto-filled from the current document, but you may type something else
   if you want to create definition for another document type.

#Item tag# (mandatory) - the tag of the element you want to define.
   Auto-filled from the element under the cursor (if any), but you may type 
   something else.

#Name column XPath# (optional) - relative XPath expression to calculate 
values displayed in the Name column.

For example, in the simplest case, if you want to display the text of the tag 
<Name> under the current element, the string should be simply #Name#; if you want to display the value of "desc" attribute,
the string is #@@desc#, etc.

#Date/time XPath# (optional) - relative XPath expression to calculate 
values displayed in the Date and Time columns. Date and time are parsed 
from the resulting text and may be either in RFC 822 format (like in RSS 
documents), or in RFC 3339 (like in Atom), or a number in UNIX #time_t# format (e.g. "1357319086"),
or time_t-based value with milliseconds (e.g. "1357319086760").

#Description column XPath# (optional) - relative XPath expression to calculate 
values displayed in the Description column.

#Owner column XPath# (optional) - relative XPath expression to calculate 
values displayed in the Owner column.

For each of these parameters (if non-empty), XPath selection is executed, 
and the resulting text is displayed in the respective column. In this way 
you can display any attributes and any text contents between the tags
under displayed elements in these four columns.

If none of the four strings are defined, the definition for this element is deleted.

In FAR 1 and 2, all the definitions are stored in the registry under the key
Plugins\YMS\XMLDOM\Special; the structure is pretty understandable if you need it.

#Note 1.# This definition has a higher priority than name column attributes defined in 
~Configuration~@Config@.

#Note 2.# Like for the name column attribute list (see ~Configuration~@Config@), you can toggle display with Ctrl-N.

#Note 3.# You can also use "scalar" XPath expressions returning single values rather than XML elements,
e.g. functions like concat, etc.
